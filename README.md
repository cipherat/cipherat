SYNOPSIS
       cipherat [OPTION]... [REPO]...

DESCRIPTION
       cipherat started his journey at 2019 when he first programmed a website called "everything-site" using HTML and
       CSS, then he discovered the real programming feeling first when he tried *python*, it was to him like a magic
       wand where he can do anything in few lines of code without much logic and debugging, after 2 years of using
       python, he finally met the holy, the great, the most feared.. The C Language.. cipherat was later found in a
       corner coffee-shop having 69 mugs of latte and 3 mechanical keyboards, with a raspberry pi 4 connected to
       nothing but a small lcd screen, unfortunately, he was found dead..  but wait, whats this note beside's him ?
       [reads note...]
